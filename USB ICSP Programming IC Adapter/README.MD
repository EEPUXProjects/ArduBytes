ArduByes USB ICSP Programming IC Adapter Development Board

The Ardubytes USB ICSP is a development board and programmer sandwiched into one. It is designed to simplify the development stage and get you programming as soon as possible. Featuring dual SPI and UPDI programming protocols it can cater for developing a range of AVR projects. Supported by AVRDUDE for SPI and megaTinyCore for UPDI. The onboard dual 5V/3V3 supply allows you to select the onboard voltage and the 44 pin (DIP EXT CONN) socket exposes every pin of the microcontroller, with some additional power pins to extend to your breadboard project. In the accidental case of bricking your microcontroller. e.g Wrong fuses. We have a built-in high voltage supply that can rescue your AVR in its time of need. All this being powered via 5V through the USB C connector.,

Features:
-	UPDI devices can be programmed via the ‚ÄúJ2‚Äù header. Based on your need they can be configured to work with a high/low voltage reset pulse. As well as being able to isolate the UPDI/Reset pin into two separate entities for those select AVRs that require this function.
-	SPI protocol is supported via the six pin ICSP header ‚ÄúJ3‚Äù or using the DIP Select adapters (Included) to program the 40 to 8 pin DIP ICs. Bricked AVRs can be saved using the AVR Unbrickme Adapter (more information to follow in due course).
-	If you need a serial USB adapter to monitor your serial lines or program your bootloader flashed AVR. Then the serial header ‚ÄúJ1‚Äù is available with the necessary connections you need to do this.
-	3.3V and 5V supplies are selectable through the ‚ÄúVCC Select‚Äù jumper. 500mA Max Current Output for 3.3V and 1A for 5V.
-	To save you time and memory üòä. The configurations for each of these functions are printed on the back of the development board for your reference. A QR Code is also available to access more information on our GitHub repository.
- 5V and 2A Supply Required.
